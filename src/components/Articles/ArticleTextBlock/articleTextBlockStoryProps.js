For a refreshingly tangy, garlicky whole dill pickle, Boar’s Head is our top pick.';

const floatImageSupplementContent = '<p>When we reviewed dill pickle spears, all the shelf-stable products were soft and soggy, while the refrigerated pickles were crisp and crunchy. That’s because the heat applied to shelf-stable pickles during pasteurization essentially cooks them and can soften their texture. But with whole dill pickles, the differences between the refrigerated and shelf-stable products were more subtle. The refrigerated pickles once again had great crunch, but the shelf-stable options were only “a little less crisp.” We quickly came to understand why the lessons we learned about pickle spears didn’t hold true for whole pickles. First, the skin surrounding a whole pickle holds it together and keeps it crisp. Second, whole pickles tend to have more mass than spears and are therefore less affected by the heat of pasteurization and more likely to retain their crunch and snap.</p>';

The smaller bowls (10 to 12 ounces) were great for sides—potato salad—or even containing a messy pulled pork sandwich or a slice of ice cream cake. However, they were too small to hold a meal-size portion of chili or a salad containing bulky greens. We found that the 16- to 20-ounce bowls were too big for a small side, but they were perfect for larger portions of soup, stew, and salad. If you’re serving a variety of foods and want to buy only one model, we think that the larger sizes are more versatile.';
