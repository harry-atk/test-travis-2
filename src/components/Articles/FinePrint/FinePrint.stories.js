They’re good foods that are better when there’s a crunchy, tangy pickle served on the side. Last year alone, Americans spent more than $1 billion on pickles, according to data from IRI, a Chicago-based market research firm. We set out to find the best whole dill pickles, which are hardier and more substantial than spears or chips and ideal for either serving alongside a meal or enjoying as a snack. We purchased pickles from eight top-selling, nationally available brands. If a brand had more than one option, we included only its best seller. One product was marketed as “garlic and dill,” one was labeled “kosher,” and six were labeled “kosher dill”— a style that originated in the kosher Jewish delis in New York City and now refers to any garlic-and-dill-flavored pickle. Our lineup also included both refrigerated and shelf-stable options. A panel of 21 America’s Test Kitchen staffers sampled them plain—served chilled at a blind tasting—rating their flavor, texture, and general appeal.</p>';
