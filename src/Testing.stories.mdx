# Testing 
Testing is important to maintain quality of any system.

**Some best practice tips to keep in mind:**
- Articulate supported component states as stories to clarify which combinations of inputs yields a given state. Ruthlessly omit unsupported states to reduce noise.
- Render components consistently to mitigate variability that can be triggered by randomized (Math.random) or relative (Date.now) inputs.

## Visual Test Appearance
Visual tests rely on developers to manually look at a component to verify it for correctness. They help us sanity check a component’s appearance as we build.

## Accessibility Tests
Disabilities affect 15% of the population according to the World Health Organization. Design systems have an outsized impact on accessibility because they contain the building blocks of user interfaces. 

Some extensions to help find and identify accessibility issues are axe DevTools and WAVE Evaluation Tool.

## Structural Testing
Structual tests focus on the structure of the UI and how it’s laid out. We want to test whether or not each component has the correct content. Mise-UI currently uses React Testing Library to test our components by querying DOM elements.

Running the Test Suite
to run all tests: `yarn run test`

to generate code coverage add `--coverage` flag
